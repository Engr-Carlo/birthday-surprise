          Today, I celebrate the woman whose love has become the rhythm of my life, whose presence turned fleeting moments into something eternal.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-cursive">
          We met when we were young, full of hope but still learning the language of love. From the very beginning, you were my calm in the chaos, my light in the quiet. When the world felt cold and uncertain, you stepped in gently, coloring my life with warmth, laughter, and meaning. You didnâ€™t just stand by me â€” you stood with me, heart open, eyes full of dreams we had not yet dared to name.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-cursive">
          Together, we faced the weight of growing up. Life was not always kind. There were nights we fell asleep exhausted, after long days of working and studying just to make ends meet. But love, real love, became our anchor. You pursued your calling in nursing, while I carved my place in engineering. The paths were hard, but our hearts never wavered.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-cursive">
          And when the world paused â€” when the pandemic tested everything and everyone â€” we held each other even closer. In the silence, we grew stronger. In uncertainty, we chose each other over and over again. We carried hope through every hardship, until one day, we crossed the finish line. You became a nurse with hands that heal and a heart that inspires. I became an engineer, building not only structures, but the future we once dreamed of in whispers.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-cursive">
          Now, as I look at you â€” the woman you have become, the love of my life â€” I am overwhelmed with gratitude. Through every trial, you remained soft, strong, and steady. You are the reason I believe in love that lasts, in devotion that deepens, in promises kept without words.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-cursive">
          Today is your birthday, but it feels like I am the one who received the gift â€” a love so rare, so patient, so true. Ours is not just a story. It is a quiet kind of forever.
